# Svelte VSCode Extension Boilerplate

## Getting Started

1. Run `npm install` in the root of the directory. 
2. Run `cd ui && npm run dev` in a Terminal Tab.
3. Press `F5` / trigger the debugger.
4. A new VSCode window should launch.
5. Open command palette `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and type in `Svelte`. You should see it under the category "Extension Examples"

## Notes

- Currently, you need to manually press the green "refresh" icon in your initial editor to trigger a refresh. I highly recommend protyping your Svelte application separately first until I can come up with a good solution.
